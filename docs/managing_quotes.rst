 Managing Quotes via Core Views
=====================================

The service is run on a number of rudimentary data models with basic scaffolding views to manage the data. User based permissions are used to control access to the data.

.. _models:

Models
======

.. _Character Group:
.. autoclass:: django_quote_service.quotes.models.CharacterGroup
.. _Character:
.. autoclass:: django_quote_service.quotes.models.Character
.. _Quote:
.. autoclass:: django_quote_service.quotes.models.Quote
.. _CharacterMarkovModel:
.. autoclass:: django_quote_service.quotes.models.CharacterMarkovModel

The data in this model is generated by a signal that fires up the asyncronous update of the model via ``markovify`` whenever a quote is added, updated, or deleted. Users never interact with this model directly.

.. _views:
